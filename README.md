# Greenfoot-game


Hey everybody,

I'm releasing this game today because I'm quite happy with the elaboration now. I only learned Java 3 months ago so please don't expect anything from me. All visual designs were created by myself. This project served as a school project, whether I want to develop it further in the future is still open.

I look forward to feedback and likes
