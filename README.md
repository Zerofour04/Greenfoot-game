## ℹ️Information
- Hey everybody, I'm releasing this game today because I'm quite happy with the elaboration now.
- I only learned Java 3 months ago so please don't expect anything from me. All visual designs were created by myself.
- This project served as a school project, whether I want to develop it further in the future is still open.
- Version: 1.1
- created by: Zerofour04 / Ben | David
- Backstory: Our game is about a robber who has robbed a bank and wants to flee from the police in his vehicle quickly, but the police came earlier than expected. The robber suddenly had to leave the bank and get into his getaway car, on the way there the police wanted to stop him. He gets in his car and flees, but the police are right behind him.
- Interfering objects: Cars appear from the front, and as soon as you touch them you lose.
The police are getting closer and closer, as soon as you touch them you lose a life, you have a maximum of 4 lives.
As the game progresses, more and more police vehicles appear.
